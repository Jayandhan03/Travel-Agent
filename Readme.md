## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: The Multi-Agent Architecture

This project is built on the concept of **agentic AI**, where different AI agents collaborate to solve a complex problem. The entire workflow is managed by **LangGraph**, creating a robust and stateful execution graph.

The core of the application is a graph where each node is a specialized agent (a "worker") and a `supervisor` agent orchestrates the flow.

graph TD
    A[User Input via Streamlit UI] --> B{Supervisor Agent};
    B --> C{Decide Next Step};
    C --> D["Research Agent <br> (Visa, general info)"];
    C --> E["Flight Agent <br> (Finds flights)"];
    C --> F["Weather Agent <br> (Gets forecast)"];
    C --> G["Hotel Agent <br> (Finds hotels)"];
    C --> H["Activities Agent <br> (Suggests things to do)"];
    
    subgraph Worker Agents
        D; E; F; G; H;
    end

    style I fill:#2E8B57,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

1.  **User Input**: The user provides trip details through the Streamlit interface.
2.  **Supervisor Agent**: This is the "team lead." It maintains the current state of the plan and decides which agent to call next.
3.  **Specialist Agents**: Each worker agent has a specific tool and responsibility (e.g., finding flights, checking the weather).
4.  **Stateful Execution**: After each agent completes its task, it updates the shared state, and control returns to the supervisor.
5.  **Itinerary Agent**: Once all necessary information is collected, this final agent reviews all the data and writes a cohesive, day-by-day itinerary.
6.  **Final Output**: The formatted itinerary is passed back to the Streamlit UI for the user to see.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

-   **Orchestration**: `LangGraph` for building stateful, multi-agent applications.
-   **LLM**: `Google Gemini Pro` for reasoning, planning, and content generation.
-   **Tools & APIs**: `SerpApi` for integrating Google Search, Flights, and Hotels APIs.
-   **Frontend**: `Streamlit` for creating the interactive web application.
-   **Deployment**: `Streamlit Cloud` for easy hosting and sharing.

## üöÄ Local Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary libraries:
```txt
streamlit
langgraph
langchain
langchain-core
langchain-google-genai
google-search-results
python-dotenv
```

Then install them:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
You will need API keys for Google Gemini and SerpApi. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your keys:
```env
# .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
SERPAPI_API_KEY="YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application should now be running locally in your browser!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Sign up or log in to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/).
3.  Click "**New app**" and connect your GitHub repository.
4.  Before deploying, go to the "**Advanced settings**".
5.  In the "**Secrets**" section, add your API keys. This is the secure way to handle them in the cloud.
    ```toml
    # Streamlit Cloud Secrets (secrets.toml format)
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    SERPAPI_API_KEY="YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
    ```
6.  Click "**Deploy!**" and your app will be live.
